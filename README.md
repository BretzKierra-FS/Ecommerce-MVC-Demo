This e-commerce demo project showcases the implementation of a simple online store, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It provides RESTful API endpoints for managing products, customers, and orders. The project's primary features include:

MVC Architecture: The project is organized into models, views, and controllers, promoting code modularity and maintainability.

RESTful API: The API offers endpoints for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products.

Dockerized MySQL Database: The project uses Docker to host a MySQL database, making it easy to set up and manage the database environment. You can access the database locally at localhost:3000.

Sequelize: Sequelize is employed as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for database interactions. It simplifies database operations and ensures database schema consistency.

Twig Templating: Twig is used for rendering views and generating dynamic HTML content. It helps separate the presentation layer from the business logic.
